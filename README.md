# Neural Network: Charity Funding Predictor

# Background

The non-profit foundation Alphabet Soup wants to create an algorithm to predict whether or not applicants for funding will be successful. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, youâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

# Project Objective
Utlizing neural metwork and machine learnig to create a binary classifier capable of predicting whether the applicants for non-profit foundation Alphabet Soup will be sucessful or not for getting fund.

# Overview of the analysis
This project includes Jupyter Notebook files that build, train, test, and optimize a deep neural network that models charity success from nine features in a loan application data set. TensorFlow Keras `Sequential` model with `Dense` hidden layers and a binary classification output layer and optimize this model by varying the following parameters are employed:

   + Training duration (in epochs)
    
   + Hidden layer activation functions
    
   + Hidden layer architecture
    
   + Number of input features through categorical variable binning
    
   + Learning rate
    
   + Batch size
